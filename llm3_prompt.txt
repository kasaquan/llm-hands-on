Aggregate paragraph analyses into final JSON. Extract law firm names from "Buyer Representative" (buyer_firm) and "Seller Representative" (seller_firm) fields. Extract "Third-Party Representation" as third_party. If "Target Company Mentioned" is "Yes" in ANY paragraph, set contains_target_firm to true.

Rules:
- Use "Not stated" if no law firm found in any paragraph
- Output ONLY valid JSON with exactly these 4 keys: buyer_firm, seller_firm, third_party, contains_target_firm
- No explanations, no markdown
